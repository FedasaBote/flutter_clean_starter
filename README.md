# Flutter Clean + Modular Architecture Template
This is a template project for Flutter that follows Clean Architecture and Modular Architecture principles. The goal of this project is to provide a basic structure that can be used as a starting point for building Flutter applications that are well-organized, maintainable, and scalable.

## Getting Started
To use this template, simply clone this repository and rename the project to your desired app name. You can then modify the project as needed to fit your requirements.

Features
This template includes the following features:

 - Clean Architecture: The project is structured using Clean Architecture principles, which separates the application into three layers: Domain, Data, and Presentation. This allows for better separation of concerns and makes the code more testable and maintainable.

 - Modular Architecture: The project is also structured using Modular Architecture principles, which separates the app into smaller, self-contained modules. This allows for better code reuse and makes it easier to add or remove functionality from the app.

 - Dependency Injection: The project uses the get_it package for dependency injection, which makes it easy to manage dependencies and ensures that the app is testable and scalable.

 - API Integration: The project includes an example of how to integrate with a remote API using a data source class and a repository class.
